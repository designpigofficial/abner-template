# Example app with [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) and TypeScript

## Notes

Chakra has supported Gradients and RTL in `v1.1`. To utilize RTL, [add RTL direction and swap](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/rtl-support).

If you don't have multi-direction app, you should make `<Html lang="ar" dir="rtl">` inside `_document.ts`.
